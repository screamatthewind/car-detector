 *  
* Overview: 
 * Standard frequency counting libraries for Arduino typically involve edge detection and interrupts, which are good for processing
 * digital signals, but not so great for weaker analog signals. 
 * 
 * Use of the Arduino on-board ADC can provide not only the frequency of the waveform, but its amplitude as well. 
 *
 * The HB-100 Microwave Doppler Radar modules are fairly cheap, but require a pre-amp circuit to boost the IF signal. I used an LM358N 
 * and the circuit at https://hackaday.io/project/371-hb100-radar-shield. The output sits at about 2.5v when the HB100 is inactive.
 * The pre-amp is sensitive to changes in components if you are breadboarding. The more stable the signal when motionless, the better 
 * this code will work.
 * 
 * Problem: 
 * The HB-100 output indicates both frequency and amplitude of the received signal. Tests using the radar shield with standard frequency
 * counters/libraries showed that using interrupts and edge-detection has limited usefullness. 
 * 
 * Goal: 
 * Detect the frequency and amplitude of low frequency (0-4khz) signals from HB-100 modules, while potentially increasing the sensitivity
 * of waveform detection using HB-100 & circuit as linked above.
 * 
 * Result:
 * A simple process uses the Arduino ADC to sample incoming signals using analog peak-to-peak detection, above and below a set 
 * "midPoint" which represents the 0v value of the AC waveform. Typically, the midpoint will be ADC_RESOLUTION / 2 or 2.5v, but in this
 * application, a value slightly lower has provided the best results 
 * 
 * Resolution / Voltage == Volts per Increment ( 1023/5v = 0.005v per Increment )
 * Sensitivity of 10 == peak-to-peak detection of +/- 0.05v signals

// Define the sensitivity of analog detection. With a very clean & consistent waveform, the sensitivity can be rased significantly.
// This value is important in determining if detected peak-to-peak values constitute a 'wave'

// will indicate speed over the previous second
